              We start with an in-depth Initial Intake form that explores where
              you are in and out of balance in the wellness categories
              (Emotional well-being, Nutritional & physical health,
              Spirituality, Creativity, Communication, Regaining a sense of

              After the Initial Intake is completed, the Breakthrough package
              consists of eight sessions (approximately one hour each). We will
              dive into each of the six wellness categories of the process and
              focus on plans, goals, and paths forward.

              The sessions are designed to illuminate the gaps of where you are
              now in life and where you want to be. And if youâ€™re not sure where
              you want to be, I can help you understand and define your journeys
              and destinations.
